vagrant-puppet-slurm
====================

A playground for testing setting up a slurm cluster (for testing purposes only). This was build by looking at the blog post [here](http://mussolblog.wordpress.com/2013/07/17/setting-up-a-testing-slurm-cluster/) by Guillermo Carrasco.

Use `vagrant up` to start the virtual cluster. Please note that the munge key is (just like everything else here) only provided for testing purposes, if you want to do something similar to bring up in a production environment you need to create a new one.
